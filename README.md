# BMW Cars Grid Display

This project showcases a collection of BMW cars displayed in a responsive grid layout using HTML and CSS. Each car image is neatly arranged using CSS Grid, providing a clean and interactive presentation.

## Features

- **Grid Layout**: The BMW cars are displayed in a responsive grid that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: A hover effect that zooms in on the images of the cars, making the interaction more engaging.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid layout adjusts dynamically to fit different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Usage

This project is primarily intended to display a grid of BMW car images. You can customize it by replacing the car image URLs with any other images of BMW cars or adjusting the grid layout in the CSS to fit your needs.

### Customizing the Grid
To change the grid layout, you can modify the `grid-template-columns` property in the `styles.css` file. For example:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); /* 4 columns of equal width */
  gap: 15px; /* Space between the images */
}
```

This will create a 4-column grid. You can adjust the number of columns to suit your design.

### Changing the Hover Effect
To modify the hover effect, locate the following block in the CSS:

```css
.grid-container img:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Zoom effect */
}
```

You can experiment with other effects like `rotate`, `opacity`, or `box-shadow`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the content and images.
